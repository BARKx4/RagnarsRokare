slavegreylings.readme

This mod is enabeling the taming (enslavement) of greylings, allowing the player to drag them home to the village and set them to perform simple tasks such as refilling kiln, fireplaces and smelters.

Made and tested with Valheim v0.148.7

Installation:
Copy the RagnarsRokare_SlaveGreyling.dll file to your BepInEx plugin folder under Valheim

Usage:
In ortder to tame a Greyling you need to "feed" (bribe) it with silver necklaces until it's tame (typically two is needed). Bribe and times are configurable.
When tamed the greyling will need Resin to keep working (also this feedtime is configurable).

Tapping E will toggle between Follow and Performing tasks.
Holding E will enable name change.

When in performing task mode the Grayling will search nearby radius for enabled tasks. It's possible to dissable tasks in the config.
At the task it will identify what is missing and search ground and nearby chests for needed items.  After a certain time or when task is finished it will continue to next task.
Many distanses and timers are configurable for better adjustments, some of them require restart for effect to take place.

Tips:
The Greyling is not verry smart. It might get stuck in tight corners or behind walls. Avoid tight multi level designs for where you deploy enslaved greylings.
